Websocketi/o

helps to send data from client to server and also updates from serve to client(data exchange)
client and server makes two way connection

http long polling( refer it) , its important

ws and wss 
==========
web socket and websocket secured protocol.



create a nodeServer
====================
create a folder named as nodeServer
navigate to that folder usind cd nodeServer
npm init  and   add all the details


then install socket.io  using the command npm i socket.io

now will create index.js thats a entry point and its our node sever


io.on is the instance of socket.io

io.on handle all the connection. socket.on is to handle the particular connection

when user has joined im appen ding user id into the users object.

coket.broadcast.emit --> is there to inform others when some one joined except himself, 
whatever the events that im created using .on method are userdefined events and you can create whatever you want.


nodeServer is different and this website is different, Im connecting this website to the nodeServer

<script src="http://localhost:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script> with this client and server are joined.
above code is of server 

I have written socket.on in index js,    and im running that in client.js by calling socket.emit()


 socket.on("send", message => {
    users[socket.id] = myusername;
    socket.broadcast.emit("recieve", {
      message: message,
      username: users[socket.id],
    });
  });

  this piece of code helps to broadcast the message to all the user



  defer :  when we use defer the script will get downlload in the background and it will be run when dom loads.
